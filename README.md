Just to take note of my light bulb moments about any ideas that comes up for a good project


<br/><h2>Reversed eCommerce</h2>
<br/>-in the standard model of where sellers post items I found an alternative
<br/>-why not let customer post what do they need and let sellers submit or bid! a product with price tags!
<br/>-still this will be integrated with a standard eCommerce model but this part will be highlited.


<br/><h2>Modular/Plugable components of eCommerce Software</h2>
<br/>-Invoice
<br/>-Catalog
<br/> ---With Search/Filter Sub Module
<br/>-Checkout
<br/>-Cart
<br/>-Payment
<br/> ---SubComponents(Per payment or transaction type)
